        <h3>summary</h3>
        <p>The big distinction between factual and fictional narratives is based on a writer’s purpose. The writers of factual stories try to recount events as they actually happened, but writers of fictional stories can depart from real people and events because the writers’ intents are not to retell a real-life event. <div>Biographies and memoirs are examples of factual stories, whereas novels and short stories are examples of fictional stories.the writer of a fictional story can create characters and events as he or she sees fit.</div>
